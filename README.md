## Summary

The Video Game Log lets users first input the names of the games they love to play. The the user can review their list of games and from that list choose which game they want to record. They can save their times then retrieve all of their accumulated times for each game.

- ExpressJS is used on the back-end with Node
- MongoDB is used as the database to store the times and games
- Mongoose is used to structure the schema in the db
- CSS to style the html

- jQuery to make ajax requests
- Sublime text editor
- PassportJS is used to authenticate users
- MochaJS to test the server
